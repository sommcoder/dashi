# Dashi - an all purpose business management dashboard (marketed towards Hospitality operations).

Dashi is a way for businesses to quickly input business logic without having to know how to use popular data management tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. 

Dashi will be connected to a relational database (PostgreSQL).

Data will be fetched with GraphQL to ensure only what the client needs is fetched and not everything else such as with using the Fetch API and REST protocol.

CSV files are uploaded and their headers are saved as templates that can then be used to upload data en masse for simplified migrations.
