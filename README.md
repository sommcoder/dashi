# Dashi - an all purpose business management dashboard (marketed towards Hospitality operations).

Dashi is a way for businesses to quickly input business logic without having to know how to use popular data management tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. 

Dashi will be connected to a relational database (PostgreSQL).

CSV, PDF, LNG and JPEG files can be uploaded and their headers saved as templates that can then be used to upload data en masse for simplified migrations.
